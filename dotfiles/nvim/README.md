# Neovim

![GitHub release (latest by date including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/paulschick/nvim?include_prereleases)

## To Do

- Implement LSP Properly
- Implement tabnine
- Implement [ThePrimeagen/harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon)
- Update styling

That's a lot of what I need for this to be my ideal configuration. I would like LSP and autocomplete, but I don't
need this to be like a terminal version of vscode.

## My Current Configuration

Neovim Version: 0.7.0

This repository should replace your `~/.config/nvim` directory.
Note that some plugins may only work on Linux.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paulschick/nvim
```

Alternatively, download the release zip file and extract into `~/.config`.
